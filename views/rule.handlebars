          Cover comes up a lot more often for ranged attacks,
          simply because itâ€™s harder for the attacker to move
          into a position with a clear shot. In melee, a character
          can usually shift 1 square to avoid attacking around a
          corner and negate most cover. A ranged attacker might
          have to move halfway across the battlefield to get a
          clear shot at a target taking cover around a corner. In
          addition to shooting a creature partially protected by a
          corner, an important situation to remember for ranged
          cover is the presence of other enemies (potential targets) between the attacker and the
          target.
